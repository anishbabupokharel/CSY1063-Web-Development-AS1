            <h2>Development Experience</h2>
            <p>Designing and creating this portfolio website was an amazing and educational journey to me. It was a way to get in touch with the very foundations of web development through HTML and CSS. At the very beginning of the module, I struggled quite a lot with the proper way to build web pages and the use of semantic HTML elements like header, nav, main, section, and footer. Little by little, through a lot of practice and experimenting with these elements, I was able to gain a better understanding of their interaction and the fact they can be used to build a clean and accessible layout.</p>
            <P>CSS was another very important area of learning for me. Setting up layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox was need a lot of trial and error, especially when it came to positioning and having a unified look throughout the website. A debugging problem such as the wrong space, hover effects, and responsiveness forced me to get more familiar with the usage of browser developer tools and validation services.</P>
            <P>In summary, this whole process helped me sharpen my problem-solving skills and at the same time, it gave me the assurance of being able to create well-structured and at the same time responsive websites.</p>

            <h2>Why This Design</h2>
            <P>
                My decision regarding the design aspect was towards the minimalist and simplistic one, which would guarantee the website's easy navigation and visual clarity. All pages are using the same header and footer for the purpose of making the user experience cohesive. The color scheme was chosen to create a professional look while still allowing good contrast for reading.
            </P>
            <p>CSS Grid was the main layout solution, which gave the freedom and fast adaption to the varying screen sizes. Interactive features were put on the website through mouse hovering over the navigation links and social media icons, but the whole design did not get complicated. This design style gives the users a chance to immerse themselves in the content while enjoying a modern touch and vibe.</p>
