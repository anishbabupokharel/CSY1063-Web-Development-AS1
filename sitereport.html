            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The site report shows my experience learning the foundmental of web development as i build my portfolio. I learn the basic of coding,designing and debugging. I concentrated on building my portfolio using sementic HTML, Responsive CSS, Grid/Flexbox, accessibility, and clean UI patterns. Along with my development log, I outline design choices, validation documentation, reference materials, and my video demonstration. Some of this report is based on the content I have drafted on my sitereport.html, including development experience and design rationale, and validation. </p>

            <h2>Why This Design</h2>
            <P>
                My decision regarding the design aspect was towards the minimalist and simplistic one, which would guarantee the website's easy navigation and visual clarity. All pages are using the same header and footer for the purpose of making the user experience cohesive. The color scheme was chosen to create a professional look while still allowing good contrast for reading.
            </P>
            <p>CSS Grid was the main layout solution, which gave the freedom and fast adaption to the varying screen sizes. Interactive features were put on the website through mouse hovering over the navigation links and social media icons, but the whole design did not get complicated. This design style gives the users a chance to immerse themselves in the content while enjoying a modern touch and vibe.</p>
