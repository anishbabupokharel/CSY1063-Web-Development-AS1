           <!-- DESIGN DECISIONS -->
        <section class="report-section">
            <h2>Designing Decision</h2>
            <p>The design of the portfolio is minimalistic and professional to ensure that it is clear and easy to navigate. The use of uniform header and footer of all pages adds cohesiveness and the use of a simple navigation bar makes the site easy to use. The font is clean with a modern anti-serif type, and readability and branding was chosen with neutral colors with accent tones. CSS Grid and Flexbox have made the site responsive to different devices and hover effects on links and icons are subtle enough not to crowd the interface.</p>
